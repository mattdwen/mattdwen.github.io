Though my career thus far has been far from normal, so perhaps my feelings aren’t indicative of the developers in general. I’m not even sure I am a developer.</p><p>The hardest part is the Bug Blues. I’m not sure if that’s a real term; I’ve never heard of it until I made it up five minutes ago. As the bug reports being to inevitably pile in, it’s easy to feel that every one is a criticism of you personally. Everyone makes genuine mistakes occasionally, but most bugs are innocent mistakes, or not even mistakes all. No matter how good the client, the project goals are always shifting,and each shift quickly becomes a bug. Strictly speaking, such occurrences should probably be filed under maintenance, but again, who’s project management workflows are 100% accurate and reliable.</p><p>Perhaps the mere mention of the word “bug” is enough to send a developer cowering. It’s hard to remove personality from the situation, but I’ve found you have to totally disconnect from a project to survive sometimes. I take great pride in what I do, and always strive to do my best, but I’ve had to work with clients so difficult that I’ve had no choice but to ignore everything I know is right, just to get the job done. And you know what? The client is totally pleased with the result!</p><blockquote><p>Perhaps the mere mention of the word “bug” is enough to send a developer cowering</p></blockquote><p>I find it very hard to watch film and television. Having spent ten years in the industry, I know what a production will go through to make the perfect shot. So when I go the cinema and there’s too much gate drift (gah, bring on digital!), or I’m watching F1 and there’s maybe a half second delay between the onboard cameras and trackside (don’t even mention audio sync), it drives me up the wall! And you know what? 99% of the population wouldn’t have half a clue. Most of the time they’ve got their televisions in the wrong aspect ratio at a minimum, when something as obvious as wheel is now the shape of an egg. And they don’t care.</p><p>Sometimes, you just have to let go. Put simply, most people are just dumber than you. Who cares if that button is 1px out of alignment on some broken browser on a decade old operating system, most people probably don’t even know it’s a button! (Sorry to everyone still running IE on XP!) Unfortunately, our professional pride makes it hard to let go. It’s the people who are smarter you who matter to you. So while we pander to the masses, it’s the people you work, in the same industry, and especially those you look up to, who you’re really working to please. If you’re lucky enough, they’ll notice it’s not totally broken, and you might even get a “nice job”.</p><blockquote><p>Put simply, most people are just dumber than you</p></blockquote><p>It’s very rare to get genuine praise for what you’ve done. I don’t go actively seeking it, and I usually dismiss it, but it’s still nice. But is it enough to beat the never ending bug queue? My current work mates tend to quite celebratory when a new site goes live, and rightly so. But by then, I’ve usually well moved on to other projects, and it’s been ruined by so many small tweaks to accommodate client changes, that the original, perfect, concept is but a mere distant memory. It just doesn’t light my fire.</p><p>So what does get me going? Probably the most personally satisfying is the rare occasion of solving something complex, in a simple, elegant manner. But there’s maybe five instances I’ve experienced that in the last six months, over which I’ve been working on a single project. I’ve probably written tens of thousands of lines, and there’d be under a hundred which meet this criteria. I have no recollection what any would be, lost moments afterwards in a myriad of curly braces.</p><p>It sounds like I hate my job. Far from it. I love what I do, so much that I do it in my spare time anyway. I don’t think I’m very good at it, but that’s a story for another day. Why do I keep doing it? I love what’s possible. I love the community. I do it in the hope that one day I’ll be able to create something that is perfect.</p></div><footer class=footer role=contentinfo><p><small>&copy 2014 Matt Dwen.
